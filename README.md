4. Advise the management of KMS on what to do to increase the revenue from the bottom 10 customers?

To do that we will need to check some relationship within the data;

   What are the Bottom 10 customers according to sales?
```sql
select top 10 Customer_Name,
sum(sales) as total_sales
from [Kms sql case study]
group by Customer_Name
order by total_sales asc;
```
![Screenshot (82)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2113e0c9-7ac5-47ab-9980-97076c5b9794)

What is the bottom 10 customers by Region and Customer segment?
```sql
	SELECT 
    [Customer_Name],
    region,
    [Customer_Segment]
FROM 
    [Kms sql case study]
WHERE 
    [Customer_Name] IN (
        SELECT TOP 10 [Customer_Name]
        FROM [Kms sql case study]
        GROUP BY [Customer_Name]
        ORDER BY SUM(sales) ASC
    )
GROUP BY 
    [Customer_Name], region, [Customer_Segment];
```
What is the Bottom 10 Customers by Product Category?
```sql
select Customer_Name,Product_Category,
sum(sales) as category_sales
from [Kms sql case study]
where Customer_Name in (
        select top 10 [Customer_Name]
        from[Kms sql case study]
        group by [Customer_Name]
        order by sum(sales) asc)
group by
    [Customer_Name], [Product_Category]
order by 
    [Customer_Name], category_sales desc;
```

* Introduce loyalty incentives for low-frequency customers
* Explore regional marketing in the regions they are from.

11. If the delivery truck is the most economical but the slowest shipping method and Express Air is the fastest but the most expensive one, do you think the company appropriately spent shipping costs based on the Order Priority?

To answer that, I first analyzed average Shipping Cost by Shipping Mode and Order Priority
 ```sql
    	SELECT 
    Order_Priority,
    Ship_Mode,
    COUNT(DISTINCT Order_ID) AS Number_Of_Orders,
    AVG(Shipping_Cost) AS Avg_Shipping_Cost
FROM 
    [KMS Sql Case Study]
GROUP BY 
    Order_Priority, Ship_Mode
ORDER BY 
    Order_Priority, Ship_Mode;
```

### Insight

KMS appears to be:

* Using Express Air for 33% Critical orders.
* However, 33% of Low priority orders were also shipped using Express Air, which may be inflating costs unnecessarily.
* High priority orders and Crititcal priority orders shipped by Delivery Truck is about 33% and  could result in delays that hurt customer satisfaction.
---

### Recommendation
* Match Order Priority to appropriate shipping modes.
* Set guardrails in the order system to prevent low-priority orders from using Express Air.
* Consider incentives for customers to choose economy shipping when urgency is low.
